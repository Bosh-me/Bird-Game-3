this [[Game Mode]] will be first one we make will be like most videos we saw 
not competitive will be more focused into proximity chat trying birds living as a bird and trolling 
doesn't tie you to any objective but you get 3 lives and u lost stamina overtime u have to eat and consume eggs u can replenish stamina by sitting on your nest 
losing your nest will not just make u lose a good stamina recovery method but u'll not respawn

thinking to change this into a rust like mode nest and collecting resources and raiding other nests
