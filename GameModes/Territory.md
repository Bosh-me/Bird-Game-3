u can choose any bird breed u like
u and 9 other players (total of 10 players)
this game mode has couple of sections 
# early stages
First : u start as a bird with 3 eggs and bad nest u start either exploring or leveling ur nest to hatch more eggs or make hatching better with higher quality birds or faster hatching rate
# mid stage
birds hatch and u can command them to do certain tasks 
Scout ,Attack ,Scavenge ,Create nests and increase territory range

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
# Late stage 
dominate other birds and win
=======

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
# In depth
after u choose this game mode and matchmaking you are face with a menu where you can choose the bird you want to play as each bird has different traits some have more benefits in different maps for example humming bird can get extra stamina when consuming sweet nectar from flowers penguins have resistance in cold maps and different movement since they can't fly tho they can glide very fast to nests to steal eggs to to deal high damage to enemies 
so keep attention the map you are playing it might be game changing for you or against you

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

after choosing your bird you spawn on your nest with few eggs your objective is to successfully hatch these eggs so they can help u
# Hatching 
it is an automatic process but it either increases or decreases if it reaches 0 you are on your own unless u manage to steal another player egg
you will be that bird parent no matter what different breed of birds u have stolen
after leveling up by consuming eggs or completing different objectives you will gain eggs u can plant in an existing nest or make a new one if the nests u have are full
# Leveling 
the more u level the more powerful u become u can choose different powerups like speed or damage or eggs
